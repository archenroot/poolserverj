This is a very simple and naive signal-to-message translator to sit
between bitcoind and poolserverj.

bitcoind (with JoelKatz 4diff patch) sends a SIGUSR1 to a defined pid on a
new block event.  poolserverj supports multiple bitcoinds so it needs to
know which one sent the signal. Apparently Java is a bit suck with signals
hence psj_sigmon.

It simply listens for a SIGUSR1, matches up the sending pid with a pidfile
you have defined in config, then sends the matching identity to each psj you
have also defined in the config. I fully expect this to be redundant when
bitcoind can do the signalling itself.

DISCLAIMERS:
This is a single threaded, blocking network daemon. If any poolserverj is
slow to accept the connect() we make to it, it will stall. If you have
multiple poolserverj, subsequent ones will be delayed in getting the message.

The config file is very basic and is just a csv using the first value per
line as a directive then subsequent values as params. You can probably quite
easily blow it up by feeding it crap in here.

There is an arbitrary limit of 50 bitcoind definitions, and 50 psj
definitions. Edit psj_sigmon.h if you need more.
